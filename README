Video Conversion Daemon
Written by Landon Spear (spearl@colorado.edu)

This project consists of two parts: a daemon and a client.

The daemon listens for an XML RPC on port 8080 with the in and out filenames to be given to avconv.

The client is ment to be run inside a web framework and sends the RPC to the daemon, waits for the callback and prints the results.

Currently this only works on a local client
